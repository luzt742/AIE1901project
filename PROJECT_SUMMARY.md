# Statistical WebApp Development Issues and Solutions

This document summarizes the key issues encountered and solutions implemented during the development of the statistical data analysis web application.

## Problem 1: Initial White Screen on Application Load

### Issue Description
When the application was first loaded, it displayed a white screen with no visible content, even though there were no errors in the browser console.

### Root Cause Analysis
The application was initializing with `dataset` and `distribution` states set to `null`. Without any initial data, the main components (Basic Statistics Tab and MLE/MoM Tab) had nothing to render, resulting in a blank interface.

### Solution Implemented
Added an initialization function in `App.tsx` to generate sample normal distribution data on application startup:

```tsx
const getInitialData = () => {
  // 生成100个服从正态分布的随机数作为初始数据
  const data = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    // 使用Box-Muller变换生成正态分布随机数
    const u1 = Math.random();
    const u2 = Math.random();
    const z = Math.sqrt(-2 * Math.log(u1)) * Math.cos(2 * Math.PI * u2);
    data.push(10 + 5 * z); // 均值为10，标准差为5
  }
  return data;
};

const [dataset, setDataset] = useState<number[] | null>(getInitialData());
const [distribution, setDistribution] = useState<DistributionInfo | null>({
  type: 'normal',
  name: '正态分布',
  formula: 'f(x) = (1/(σ√(2π))) * e^(-(x-μ)²/(2σ²))',
  parameters: { mean: 10, std: 5 }
});
```

This ensures the application always starts with meaningful sample data displayed, providing a better user experience.

## Problem 2: GitHub Pages Deployment White Screen

### Issue Description
While the application worked correctly on localhost, it displayed a white screen when deployed to GitHub Pages.

### Root Cause Analysis
Incorrect base path configuration in `vite.config.js`. The original configuration included the GitHub username in the base path:

```javascript
base: '/luzt742/AIE1901project/', // 项目在GitHub上的仓库名称
```

This caused the browser to look for JavaScript assets at `https://luzt742.github.io/luzt742/AIE1901project/assets/...` instead of the correct path `https://luzt742.github.io/AIE1901project/assets/...`.

### Solution Implemented
Modified the `base` path in `vite.config.js` to only include the repository name:

```javascript
base: '/AIE1901project/', // 正确的GitHub Pages基础路径
```

After updating the configuration, the application was rebuilt and redeployed to GitHub Pages, resulting in correct asset loading and rendering.

## Problem 3: Large Bundle Size Warning

### Issue Description
During the build process, Vite warned that some chunks were larger than 500 kB after minification:

```
(!) Some chunks are larger than 500 kBs after minification. Consider:
- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The application bundles all components and dependencies into a single large JavaScript file, which exceeds the recommended size for optimal web performance.

### Solution Implemented
While the application works correctly with the current configuration, a future enhancement could implement code splitting using dynamic imports to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.

## Summary of Changes

1. Added initial sample data generation to ensure content is always displayed on application load
2. Corrected the base path configuration for proper GitHub Pages deployment
3. Documented bundle size optimization opportunities for future improvements

These changes have resulted in a fully functional statistical analysis web application that works both locally and when deployed to GitHub Pages.
